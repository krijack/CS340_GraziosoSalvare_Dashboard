# CS340_GraziosoSalvare_Dashboard
Interactive MongoDB + Dash dashboard for identifying and managing rescue dog candidates for Grazioso Salvare. Built for SNHU CS340.

Reflection Journal
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Maintainable code comes from structure and simplicity. In my CRUD Python module, I used clear method names (create, read, update, delete) and parameterized logic, making it reusable for any MongoDB collection. Using object-oriented design allowed me to keep database logic separate from the dashboard’s presentation layer. This separation made the code easy to adapt for future projects that might need database interaction, such as other rescue organizations or analytics dashboards.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I start with analysis and decomposition — breaking the problem into smaller, testable parts. For this project, I first ensured database connectivity (the CRUD module), then built the data visualization layer in stages: data retrieval, filtering, and interactive mapping. My approach here was more systematic and modular compared to earlier assignments. Going forward, I would continue using iterative prototyping — testing and refining each feature — to meet client needs efficiently.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists transform data into decision-making tools. For Grazioso Salvare, my work allows trainers to identify potential rescue dogs quickly through an intuitive dashboard. This directly supports their mission to save lives. The project demonstrates how thoughtful data systems design can amplify real-world impact — bridging the gap between information and action.
